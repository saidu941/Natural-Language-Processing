Data cleaning and preprocessing- Natural Language Processing

Given a spelling corrector source code, we are aiming to go even deeper in some concept in natural language processing. 
In this use-case we will learn how to correct themis-typing of words in a sentence.Spelling corrector is about using some of the NLP features we learned during the class then correcting a mis-typed word. 

Work on text processing using 
unigram, 
bigram, 
trigram, 
tokenization, 
pose tagging, 
lemmatization,
