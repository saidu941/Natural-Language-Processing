Data cleaning and preprocessing- Natural Language Processing

Given a spelling corrector source code, we are aiming to go even deeper in some concept in natural language processing. 
In this use-case we will learn how to correct themis-typing of words in a sentence.Spelling corrector is about using some of the NLP features we learned during the class then correcting a mis-typed word. 

Work on text processing using 
unigram, 
bigram, 
trigram, 
tokenization, 
pose tagging, 
lemmatization, 
normalization, 
entity extraction, 
language model.


Tokenization: when applied to data security, is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.

Stemming: is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form.

part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST): called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context—i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph.

Lemmatization: refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.

Trigrams: are a special case of the n-gram, where n is 3. They are often used in natural language processing for doing statistical analysis of texts.

Named-entity recognition (NER): (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times,
